        Hi, I'm Chilaka Michael Obinna,
        a Frontend Engineer that creates easy to use, fun, innovative, accessible and user-friendly websites and applications; looking forward to open critics by users. I translate designs to frontend code and determining developer requirements. I'm always humbled and know nothing that's my slogan.
        <br>
        <p>I'm currently working at <a href="https://meetmatch.biz">MeetMatch</a>  as a Frontend Engineer. I have had the opportunity of developing websites and products, to mention but a few are <a href="https://omnibiz.com/">Omnibiz</a>, <a href="https://rubystack.io/">RubyStack</a> and 
        <a href="https://farmruby.com">FarmRuby</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I actually got started with computers at age 16, when I had a diploma certificate on computer. I learnt the following software packages Desktop Publishing, Microsoft Word, 
    Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint; Corel Draw and Paint were killer softwares for graphics by then, and I was so good with them and still know those tools
    but not as before because my concentration is now shifted. I had to work as a System Administrator for years even after
    graduation. In school then, I had these 3 friends who were in Computer Science Department, not same department with me <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/echilaka1/">Emmanuel</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/victor-ikoro-47b30153/">Victor</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/richard-ekwonye-5372a8a6/">Richard</a> these guys were really good and I learnt a lot from them. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I got into Web development late 2017, then I don't really know my way around it though, and I had to teach an IT student, who came to the firm to learn web development, lol. In my eagerness to learn web development, I had a leap as an intern at <a href="https://learnfactory.com.ng/">Learn Factory Nigeria</a> where I learnt a lot about web and mobile development in 2018; domain and web hosting and ever since, I haven't looked back.</p>
